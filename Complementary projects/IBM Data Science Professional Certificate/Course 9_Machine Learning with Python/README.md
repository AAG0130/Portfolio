# Weather Data — Model Comparison (Regression & Classification)

## Project summary
This notebook loads the Weather_Data CSV, preprocesses categorical variables with one-hot encoding, and trains multiple models (Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM) to predict rainfall. The notebook reports regression and classification metrics to compare model performance.

**Important notice:**  
Documentation within this notebook was improved and additional explanatory comments were added to facilitate reproducibility and reading. The **original course assignment design and associated intellectual property belong exclusively to IBM Corporation**. The code logic of the original assignment was kept intact except for minimal corrections necessary to ensure the notebook runs without errors.
