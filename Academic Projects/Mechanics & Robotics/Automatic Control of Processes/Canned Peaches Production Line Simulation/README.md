## Project summary

This project aims to design and simulate an automated production line for canned peaches in syrup named "Golden Bytes". Several subprocesses are proposed, encompassing everything from raw material intake to the final product output. For each of these subprocesses, the necessary sensors and actuators are identified, and their operation is simulated using available robotic models.

## Context

Each subprocess was assigned to a different team member. An explanation of the Peeler, Blancher, and Cleaner subprocess can be found in the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnhh0MOvk7k&t=26s
