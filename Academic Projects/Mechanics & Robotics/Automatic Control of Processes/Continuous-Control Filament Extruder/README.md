## Project summary

This project aims to design and build a filament extruder that repurposes recycled PET bottles, using two continuous control systems: one for regulating the filament spool speed and another for controlling the extruder temperature. The system is implemented with an Arduino MEGA and a 12V regulated power supply, integrating both controllers on the same hardware. The temperature control system manages the heating element of the extruder, while the speed control system governs the motor-driven spool with encoder feedback. The project involves developing mathematical models, transfer functions, and open-loop analyses for both systems, followed by the design and implementation of PID controllers to meet specific performance criteria. The final stage includes deploying the controllers on the Arduino and validating their performance through experimental testing.

## Context

The project was developed in the context of the course and with the resources available at EAFIT University. The Arduino codes were stored on the university's computers; therefore, they are not available for inclusion in the repository.
