## Project summary

This project involves the design and manufacturing of a 11-bar 2-degree-of-freedom CNC router for soft materials, capable of cutting up to 1 mm deep into a wooden sheet. The system is developed using the equipment available in the mechatronics laboratory, including two NEMA34 stepper motors with their drivers and power supplies, one 400 mm lead screw with nut, two 400 mm linear guides, and four linear bearings. The project focuses on the mechanical design, motion control, and integration of these components to achieve precise and efficient material cutting.

**Note:** There are no photos of the manufactured CNC other than the one provided (which shows the CNC still not finished).  

## Context

For the project, the **conceptual design**, **calculations**, and **technical drawings** must be developed. Each component includes the following:

**Conceptual Design:**

* State of the art
* Design brief
* Design architecture
* Conceptual design
* Design proposal
* Preliminary calculations

**Calculations:**

* Kinematic analysis
* Static analysis
* Failure analysis
* Finite element analysis (FEA)

**Drawings:**
Technical drawings of all parts required for manufacturing.
