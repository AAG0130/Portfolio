## Project summary

This is a project proposal that aims to **improve water quality** in a rural area by **reducing up to 95% of solid waste** in a small stream (2 m wide, 1.5 m deep) before it reaches the water treatment plant.

The proposed system consists of a **modular floating device** equipped with **capture and filtration mechanisms**, powered by **renewable energy**, and capable of **automatic waste separation and compaction** with minimal human intervention. It also integrates **safety measures** and a **shore-based maintenance platform** for waste collection and management.

This initiative addresses a critical environmental issue in rural Colombia, where the lack of adequate solid waste and wastewater treatment systems severely affects water quality and ecosystems. By preventing solid waste—such as plastics, glass, metals, and organics—from entering waterways, the project contributes to **sustainable water resource management**, **ecosystem protection**, and **operational efficiency** in water treatment processes.

**Important Notice:** 

This is a project proposal that was developed within the context of the course; therefore, it was not implemented in a real-world scenario.
