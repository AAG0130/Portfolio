## Project summary

This project proposes the development of a **cloud-based technological management platform** to integrate monitoring and diagnostic services aimed at improving productivity in railway systems. Through **IoT and data analytics**, the platform will collect and analyze information from various monitoring and condition-diagnosis systems to generate **KPI indicators** that support informed decision-making and efficient asset management. Proposed by **Universidad EAFIT** in collaboration with **Metro de Medellín** and funded by the **CIDT**, the initiative addresses the challenge of low productivity caused by the lack of integration among technical subsystems such as energy, signaling, maintenance, and operations.

The solution involves implementing an **Asset Performance Management (APM)** platform aligned with **ISO 55000** standards and compatible with **Enterprise Asset Management (EAM)** systems. Initially focused on the **bogie subsystem**, the platform will integrate real-time monitoring technologies like **SKF Insight Rail** to assess component health—such as bearings, wheels, and suspension—optimizing maintenance scheduling and reducing downtime, costs, and lifecycle impact.

The project aims to enhance operational efficiency, transparency, and collaboration across technical and administrative levels, bridging KPI-driven insights with business objectives. Over a **24-month period**, the initiative will deliver five key outcomes: two research documents, one asset management software, one management platform, and a software registration. Its successful implementation is expected to significantly contribute to **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13**, promoting sustainability, competitiveness, and technological advancement in urban transportation.
