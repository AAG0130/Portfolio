## Project summary

This project focuses on the **implementation and evaluation of numerical methods** to solve engineering problems relevant to professional practice. It addresses real-world cases such as **industrial furnace cooling analysis (nonlinear equations)**, **mechanism synthesis (systems of equations)**, and **stress-strain curve modeling for A36 steel (interpolation)**. Using **Matlab and Python**, various numerical techniques are programmed and compared in terms of accuracy and efficiency, enabling a deeper understanding of their application and performance in solving practical engineering challenges.

## Context

Each analysis was developed independently using `MATLAB 9.12.0`.
