## Project summary

This project focuses on the **verification and validation of a metallic frame** using analysis and design tools based on finite element methods. A load of **38.38 kg** was applied to a specific point on the frame, and strain data were collected using a **strain gauge rosette** to measure the planar deformation state. The 3D geometry was modeled in **SolidWorks** to develop a static **finite element model (FEM)** that replicates real loading and boundary conditions. The results from experimental strain measurements were compared with FEM predictions to evaluate accuracy. The study includes the analysis of stresses, deformations, potential sources of error, and proposed improvements to the model, ensuring a reliable structural validation process.

## Context

* The 3D model and FEM were developed using `SolidWorks `version 2022.
* The gauge measurement was done using `MATLAB`.
