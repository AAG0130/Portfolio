## Project summary
The project aims to simulate injection molding, casting, and deep drawing processes using the ALTAIR Inspire MOLD, ALTAIR Inspire CAST, and ALTAIR Inspire FORM applications, respectively, on three parts designed in SolidWorks. Parameters, methods, and simulation techniques are defined for each part, and the results are then collected, analyzed, and interpreted.

## Context

* Each part was designed independently using `SolidWorks` version 2022 (the lid part was provided by the professor).
* Each simulation was executed independently using ALTAIR Inspire MOLD, ALTAIR Inspire CAST, and ALTAIR Inspire FORM.
