## Project summary

This project focuses on the material selection for redesigning a thermos bottle, addressing the main shortcomings of current hydration products. While disposable plastic bottles contribute heavily to environmental pollution and can release harmful compounds like BPA, traditional thermoses often suffer from poor impact resistance, low thermal insulation, and excessive weight or cost. The proposed design aims to create a durable, lightweight, and thermally efficient thermos capable of withstanding drops and impacts while maintaining beverage temperature. The result seeks to offer users a sustainable, safe, and convenient solution for hydration in daily activities outside the home.

## Context

For the material selection process, the `CES Edupack` software, provided by the materials laboratory of Universidad EAFIT, was used.
