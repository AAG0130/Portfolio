# NIIF16 Process Automation

## Project summary
This project automates the IFRS 16 (NIIF 16) accounting process (responsible for lease recognition and reporting) through a technological solution that reduces human risk and ensures compliance with SOX (Sarbanes–Oxley) requirements. The solution automates four key stages of the process: accounting reconciliation, expense reversal, account reclassification, and form completion. The project combined technical expertise in data science, software development, and process automation to design and implement a scalable tool that enhances efficiency, accuracy, and transparency in financial operations.

## Context
This project was developed within Bancolombia’s Vice Presidency of Customer and Employee Services, specifically in the Supply Chain Directorate and the Supplier Management section. It was part of the Universidad EAFIT apprenticeship program and was presented as the capstone project.

## Objectives

### General Objective:

Automate the IFRS 16 compliance process within Bancolombia’s supplier invoice payment workflow by the beginning of November through a technological solution that minimizes human risk, ensuring accurate accounting reconciliation, expense reversal, account reclassification, and form completion, while improving operational efficiency and complying with SOX regulations.

### Specific Objectives:

1. Acquire the necessary business knowledge to establish a theoretical framework and determine the project’s requirements and dependencies.
2. Automate the accounting reconciliation stage using Python and verify its results.
3. Automate the expense reversal stage using Python and verify its results.
4. Automate the account reclassification stage using Python and verify its results.
5. Automate the form completion stage using Python and verify its results.
6. Integrate the individual developments of the four stages into a unified infrastructure, including both front-end and back-end components.
7. Conduct functional testing, document the code, and create a user guide.
8. Ensure the project complies with corporate standards and formalize the solution as an EUC (End User Computing) tool.
